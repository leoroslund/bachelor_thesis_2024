# bachelor_thesis_2024
Project files when simulating an electrified construction site as a part of my Bachelor Thesis written together with G. Rolandsson, A. Ahagen and S. Hedar.

The file linear_regression_battery_capacity.py was used to create a linear regression of battery capacity to create larger battery machines based on current ones. 

The simulation_v13.py is the actual simulation that we did, it is using the SimPy package to perform an DES (Discrete event simulation).

There are two style sheets, leostyle2.mplstyle is used with the linear regression file and leostyle3.mplstyle is used together with the simulation. Both are made to make great looking graphs that would fit the way we wanted into our Bachelor Thesis.
